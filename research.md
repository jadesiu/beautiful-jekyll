2. **The Freedom to Choose: Theory and Quasi-Experimental Evidence on Cash Transfer Restrictions** (with Olivier Sterck and Cory Rodgers) <br/>
There has been a sharp increase in the adoption of cash transfer programmes worldwide, but the question of how cash transfers should be implemented remains. We address the question by evaluating theoretically and empirically the impact of switching cash transfer modalities: from one restricted to food items and to another unrestricted. If the restrictions are binding, our model predicts that the beneficiaries of unrestricted transfers will have higher non-food expenditures. We test the theoretical predictions empirically by analysing the effect of a cash transfer programme change, which provides a natural experiment, in a refugee settlement in Kenya. Consistent with theory, we find that the programme change from restricted to unrestricted cash transfer has led to an increase in household asset holdings and temptation goods. As expected, unrestricted cash transfers reduce the likelihood of reselling food items. The magnitude of the impact however is surprisingly small. This is partly explained by the constrained credit system. We uncover heterogeneity in effects by household indebtedness -- an issue faced by 89 percent of the surveyed households. By combining household survey data and ethnographic data, we show that indebtedness has serious implications for the effectiveness of cash transfer programmes in improving household welfare. <br/>
